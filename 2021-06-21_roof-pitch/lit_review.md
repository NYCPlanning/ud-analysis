## LiDAR Building Analysis Literature Review

---

### Questions:
- What are the impacts of changes to roof regulations such as the Fire Code, Building Codes, and Zoning Resolution provisions (which have different requirements for pitched roofs and low-slope roofs)?
- How much roof area is available for technologies such as solar, cool roofs, green roofs, or batteries?  Where/which building types?
- What neighborhoods/building types currently have the most/least solar, cool roofs, green roofs, etc.?

### Data Points:
- Roof pitch
- \# roof planes / # roof areas
- Total roof area
- Location of rooftop obstructions (e.g. solar, parapet walls, bulkheads, equipment, spires)
- Roof shading
- Existing solar/green roof installations (the most granular solar data we have is at the zip-code level, we don't have comprehensive green roof data)
- Albedo 
- Existing cool roofs ( we only know about cool roofs that have been coated through SBS not the state of white roofs in general, we could use albedo analysis to figure this out).
